        About Our Website
        Nearly 55% of the population of India is in agricultural or allied sector services. But
even in this condition, we don’t see effective buying and selling of the vegetables.
Farmers have to go door to door finding their right audience. Moreover customers
sometimes have to buy the vegetables at the wrong prices as they cannot compare the
prices.
To overcome this problem, we have proposed a website. In this website, we maintain
the information of farmers like their contact information, their products, etc which are
easily seen by the customers with an user friendly interface.
Farmers nowadays travel door by door to sell their vegetables. Moreover there are
chances that the vegetables which are required by the customers are not available with
the farmers.
Moreover, the customers are unable to get the vegetables at the right price. They
cannot compare the prices as they are not aware about all the sellers.
To overcome this problem, we made an online platform called ‘Farmer’s Magic’ so
that it will be beneficial for both farmers as well as customers.
Our main objective is to empower farmers.
This website acts as a bridge between farmers and customers. It connects the farmers
and customers for effective trading.
